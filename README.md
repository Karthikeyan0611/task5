🚢 Titanic Survival EDA Project
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

This project explores the classic Titanic dataset using Python to uncover patterns and gain insights into what factors influenced passenger survival. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, the goal is to build a strong understanding of the dataset and its features.

📁 Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle - Titanic Dataset

Rows: 891

Columns: 12

Features include: Age, Gender, Passenger Class, Fare, Embarked, and Survival Status

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

📌 Project Structure & Steps
🔍 1. Data Overview
Used .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts() to understand data structure and distribution.

🧩 2. Missing Value Analysis
Identified missing values in:

Age

Cabin

Embarked

📊 3. Univariate Analysis
Analyzed individual features:

Categorical: Sex, Pclass, Embarked

Numerical: Age, Fare

🔄 4. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
Explored relationships between features and survival using:

Bar plots

Boxplots

Heatmaps

Violin plots

Key factors analyzed:

Gender

Age

Passenger class

Fare

Embarkation point

💡 Key Insights
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate.

Class: First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Age: Younger passengers had better survival odds.

Fare: Higher fares were associated with increased survival rates.
